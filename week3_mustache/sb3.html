	X- Create a web page and name it "sb3.html".
	X- This page will not utilize and external Javascript or CSS
	Create JavaScript that will define a variable named "students".
	This variable should be assigned a JSON object that contains a property named results. The results property should contain an array of values. Each element in the array should contain the following properties for a student:
	firstname
	lastname
	gpa
	gender
	degree_program
	enrolled_courses - This property should contain an array of courses that the student is enrolled in
	There should be a minimum of 4 different students in the results value array including all of the courses that the student is enrolled in. The courses should be displayed on the page separated by commas.
	Now write some JavaScript to display all of the student data from the JSON on the web page.
	All work should be your own.
	Upload your sb3.html file to Canvas.
